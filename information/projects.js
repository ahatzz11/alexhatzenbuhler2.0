            "Hi! My name is Alex Hatzenbuhler. I grew up in Apple Valley MN and am currently a Senior at North Dakota State University. I will be graduating in May 2015 with a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science. I have been interested in anything related to technology since I was tall enough to reach the VCR machine. I started coding and developing my freshman year of college and I soon became passionate about computer science. Since then I have developed a strong interest in android and web development.",
            "Outside of my professional interests I listen to a lot of music, discover many unique craft beers, and enjoy staying up to date on all things related to technology. I have developed an interest in some computer hardware as well. I built my own desktop computer a couple years ago, and have helped a few friends with their own. I also enjoy biking, snowboarding, and playing ultimate frisbee in my free time.\n"
